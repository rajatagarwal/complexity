# Complexity

(Learning from: http://discrete.gr/complexity/)

## Motivation:
'Profilers' are the tools which measures how fast a program runs in milliseconds and can also help us find bottlenecks in our code. 

It is alright as we do not want to measures our programs but the 'ideas' of algorithms. We should not measure implementation of the algorithm because comparing the implementation of an algorithm is not pragmatic. A bad algorithm implemented in the assembly language can run faster than the good algorithm implemented in the high level language like Python, Ruby etc. 

Algorithms are programs that perform just a computation. Complexity analysis is the way to determine how fast a program is when it perform computation. In other words, complexity analysis is the way to determine how fast our algorithm is. Examples of program that just perform computations are:
    1. Numeral floating point operations such as addition and subtraction.
    2. Searching within a database that fits in RAM for a given value.
    3. Determining the path an artificial intelligence character will walk through in a video game so that they only have to walk a short distance within their virtual world. 
    4. Running a regular expression pattern to match a string.
